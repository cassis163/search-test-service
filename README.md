# ec-search-service
Used for testing the applicability of event sourcing!
## Behaviour
Receives Pub/Sub messages from the product-test-service and stock-test-service and processes them into events.
The resulting events will be registered and managed (possibly with EventStoreDB).
Event sourcing revolves around deriving state from a start (snapshot) and a series of events.
In this case, the stored events will be used to get the state of product options, stock and possibly products.

Event sourcing is often implemented with the CQRS pattern to make it more intuitive.
However, CQRS is not a requirement for the implementation of event sourcing.
